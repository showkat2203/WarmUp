Can we access private data members of a class without using a member or a friend function?
The idea of Encapsulation is to bundle data and methods (that work on the data) together and restrict access of private data members outside the class. In C++, a friend function or friend class can also access private data members.

Is it possible to access private members outside a class without friend?
Yes, it is possible using pointers.
